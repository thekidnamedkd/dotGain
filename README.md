#### Notes & Blurbs for Presentation

* _"I chose Gatsby to quickly bootstrap a project within a React framework by combining the speed and convenience of GraphQL with a basic frontend."_
* _"I found the headless CMS and ecommerce starter within many examples of why developers are quickly bootstrapping projects with Gatsby to take advantage of a Content Mesh of microservices that integrate quickly, cutting down development time and spinning up a platform for my MVP very nicely."_
