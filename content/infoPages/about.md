### A printing term used to describe when dots are printing larger than they should. Total dot gain therefore is the numerical difference between the negatives and corresponding dot size on the paper.

dotGain aims to be a reliable place to gather and view art that has been made around social justice movements and then provide those who wish to support those artists and independent print shops with their business rather than FedEx or other corporate outlets. By creating a one-stop portal for artists to share their work in a financially supportive environment, and including local independent print shops as the producer of this art–bespoke or at commercial scale–we hope to infuse protest movements and public spaces, private homes and businesses throughout the community, with meaningful art that supports a collective movement through group economics and accessible tech.
